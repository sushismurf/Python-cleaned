questions on [GitHub](https://github.com/zhiwehu/Python-programming-exercises/blob/master/100%2B%20Python%20challenging%20programming%20exercises.txt) with my solutions.
the questions seem to be numbered until 26, and they seem to continue with only the name 'Question' afterwards. i've kept the numbering going regardless.
in addition, some questions are duplicates of each other or have incomplete solutions, so i've tried my best to write some code that actually works.
please do keep in mind that some questions have longer answers than usual since i considered wrong inputs from the user. they are not necessary, but a nice touch in my opinion.
