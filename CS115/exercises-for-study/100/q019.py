q: You are required to write a program to sort the (name, age, height) tuples
by ascending order where name is string, age and height are numbers.
The tuples are input by console. The sort criteria is:
1: Sort based on name;
2: Then sort based on age;
3: Then sort by score.
The priority is that name > age > score.
If the following tuples are given as input to the program:
Tom,19,80
John,20,90
Jony,17,91
Jony,17,93
Json,21,85
Then, the output of the program should be:
[('John', '20', '90'), ('Jony', '17', '91'), ('Jony', '17', '93'),
('Json', '21', '85'), ('Tom', '19', '80')]

# there seems to be a small mistake in the question. there is no 'score'
# value initially, intead there is 'height'. but the input takes 'height'?
# i am going to scrap height completely and use score instead.
# also, i'm not happy with how this one turned out. there must be a
# simpler way..
