q: A robot moves in a plane starting from the original point (0,0).
The robot can move toward UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT with a given steps.
The trace of robot movement is shown as the following:
UP 5
DOWN 3
LEFT 3
RIGHT 2
¡­
The numbers after the direction are steps. Please write a program to
compute the distance from current position after a sequence of movement
and original point. If the distance is a float, then just print the nearest
integer.

ex:
If the following tuples are given as input to the program:
UP 5
DOWN 3
LEFT 3
RIGHT 2
Then, the output of the program should be:
2
