# Python Practice & Coursework (Bilkent CS115 + Beyond)

contains Python code written during & after **CS115 (Introduction to Programming in Python)** course at Bilkent University.

It’s organized to separate coursework, personal practice, and other projects — intended to help both me and anyone who might find the examples useful.

This is both a **learning archive** and a **reference** for future Bilkent students or anyone learning Python. Requires **Python 3.8+**.

To run any script:

```bash
python filename.py
```
